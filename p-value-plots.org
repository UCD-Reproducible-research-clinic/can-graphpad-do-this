* Can Graphpad do this?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is a quick presentation to show you how you can present your research in a better way using RR tools. 
I called this quick demo Can GraphPad do this because I know that most people are resigned to doing things the GUI/graphpad way, but I want to show you there is another way!

Plots and code taken from:
- https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-p-values-and-significance-levels-to-ggplots/
* GraphPad
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- easy(ish) to use
- decent plots
- walks you through basic stats
- ???
* plot

- we have time series or dose-response data and we want to plot it

#+BEGIN_NOTES
GraphPad will get you a basic plot like this relatively easily (once your copy pasted from a few spreadsheets into excel that is...)
You click through some tabs, set up stuff, save a bunch of who knows what...
But, now suppose we want to know what matters?
#+END_NOTES

* statistics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- which ones are significant?

/"Write the asterisks manually"/
#+BEGIN_NOTES
No help there...
#+END_NOTES

* problem

#+REVEAL_HTML: <small>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAEYgU_kp7I</small>
#+BEGIN_NOTES
but no big deal.. 
Well then we get to this screen... 
We have all been here. 
Flip back and forth between tabs, add your bars, make sure they are even... 
Is there really that many ways to make significance bars??? How has noone solved this?

* 
$150-300/year license to copy paste asterisks?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*How is this not figured out by now?*

* What about this?
- What if you could generate a chart that looks like this with a few lines of code?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rsesh :file img/example.png :results output graphics :exports none
  library(ggplot2)
  library(ggpubr)

  data("ToothGrowth")

  ggline(ToothGrowth, x = "dose", y = "len", add = "mean_se",
            color = "supp")+
    stat_compare_means(aes(group = supp), label = "p.signif", 
                       label.y = c(16, 25, 29))

* ggpubr

- *R* programming language
Add on libraries:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- *ggplot2*
- *ggpubr*

/Free as in beer, Free as in speech/ 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is done with FREE (as in beer and libre) and OPEN SOURCE software!
#+END_NOTES

* How?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rsesh :results output :exports both
  library(ggplot2)
  library(ggpubr)
   str(ToothGrowth)
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+RESULTS:
: 'data.frame':	60 obs. of  3 variables:
:  $ len : num  4.2 11.5 7.3 5.8 6.4 10 11.2 11.2 5.2 7 ...

- This dataframe (spreadsheet) has two treatments (Orange Juice, Vitamin C)
- contains a dose and measured length of teeth

* Plot
This is as easy as:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rsesh :results silent :exports code :eval no
  library(ggplot2)
  library(ggpubr)

  data("ToothGrowth")

  ggline(ToothGrowth, x = "dose", y = "len", add = "mean_se",
            color = "supp")+
    stat_compare_means(aes(group = supp), label = "p.signif", 
                       label.y = c(16, 25, 29))
#+END_SRC

For the multiple comparisons,
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rsesh :results silent :exports code :eval no
  # specify comparisons
   my_comps <- list(c("0.5", "1"), c("1", "2"), c("0.5", "2"))

   ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x = "dose", y = "len",
             color = "dose")+ 
     stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comps,
                        label.y = c(29, 35, 40))+
     stat_compare_means(label.y = 45)

* How can I do this with my data?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*come to RRN meetings!*
* How is this reproducible?
You go from your *RAW* data to this plot
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- all steps are recorded
- all steps are automated
- no copy paste mistakes!
- prettier plots!
